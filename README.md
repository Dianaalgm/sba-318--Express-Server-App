This is my endeavor to build a web server using Node.js and Express. 
I've grasped the fundamental concepts of Express and successfully implemented middleware, along with creating route paths for three distinct data categories. 
However, I faced some challenges while setting up route parameters for certain GET requests. 
Although I managed to develop a view template engine using basic HTML syntax within the 'views' folder, I struggled with incorporating CSS styling into the view engine.
